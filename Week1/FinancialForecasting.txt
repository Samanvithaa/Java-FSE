Financial Forecasting Theory

1. Understanding Recursive Algorithms
  Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. 
  It is particularly useful for problems that can be broken down into similar sub-problems, such as financial calculations,
  tree traversal, or factorial computation. In the context of forecasting, recursion can simplify the computation of compound growth over time.

2. Setup
  We define a method that takes the current value, the annual growth rate, and the number of years as input. 
  The method recursively applies the growth rate year by year to forecast the future value.

3. Implementation Summary
  The recursive function multiplies the current value by (1 + growthRate) for each year until it reaches the base case where years = 0.
  For optimization, an iterative version can be used to prevent call stack overhead.

4. Time Complexity
  The time complexity of the recursive implementation is O(n), where n is the number of years.
  Each recursive call represents one year of forecasting.

5. Optimization
  Although recursion simplifies logic, it can lead to performance issues due to deep call stacks, especially for large values of n. To optimize, we can:
  - Use an iterative approach to avoid recursion overhead.
  - Apply memoization if subproblems overlap (not applicable here, but useful in other recursive contexts).
  - For constant growth rates, direct mathematical formulas such as compound interest can also be used: 
    Future Value = currentValue * (1 + growthRate)^years
