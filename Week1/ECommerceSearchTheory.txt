1. Asymptotic Notation and Search Analysis
  Big O notation represents the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm. 
  It helps analyze how the performance of an algorithm scales with input size n.

  Time complexities for common search algorithms are as follows:
    i.Linear Search:
      Best Case: O(1)
      Average Case: O(n)
      Worst Case: O(n)

    ii.Binary Search:
      Best Case: O(1)
      Average Case: O(log n)
      Worst Case: O(log n)

2.Implementation Summary
  Linear search iterates through each element in the array one by one until it finds the target element or reaches the end of the array.
Binary search works by repeatedly dividing a sorted array in half, comparing the target value with the middle element,
and narrowing the search space accordingly.

3.Analysis
  Linear search is simple and works on unsorted arrays, but it becomes inefficient for large datasets due to its linear time complexity.
Binary search is more efficient with a logarithmic time complexity but requires that the array be sorted before performing the search.

4.Recommendation
  For an e-commerce platform that handles a large number of products, binary search is more suitable because of its better 
performance on sorted data. However, for dynamic datasets or real-time search needs, using advanced structures like hash maps
or relying on database indexing would be more appropriate.
